RuntimeNeeds — explicit data container for runtime-feature usage.

The first step in the "mixin-monolith -> services + passes" refactor
described in New Path.md (2026-05-04). Today, ``CTranspiler`` carries
``self.used_helpers`` (a Set[str] of helper-name strings) and a handful
of bool flags (``_needs_threading``, ``_needs_atomics``, ...) that the
helper-scan pass populates and the runtime-emit pass reads. They
travel as scattered instance attributes on a god object; nothing
documents the contract between producer and consumer.

This module turns that contract into a single dataclass. The migration
is incremental: ``HelperScanMixin`` will populate **both** ``self.used_helpers``
AND ``self.runtime_needs`` (parallel write), the corpus diff verifies
they stay in sync, then consumers flip one at a time from the loose
attributes to the dataclass. When all consumers have flipped, the loose
attributes can be deleted.

Why a dataclass and not a TypedDict / dict[str, bool]?

- ``slots=True`` shaves the per-instance dict overhead (one flag is one
  attribute, not one hash-table entry).
- Default values are explicit and centralized.
- Field access is a real attribute reference, so mypy / pyright catch
  typos at edit time.
- Equality / repr come for free, which makes the corpus diff harness
  easier ("did this scan produce the same RuntimeNeeds as last run").

    """Which runtime-helper categories does the program actually use?

    Produced by the helper-scan pass; consumed by the C and LLVM emit
    passes to gate which fragments they include in the output.

    The ``helpers`` set carries the fine-grained string keys (e.g.
    "strlen", "ailang_strcat", "tcp_recv"); the bool flags carry the
    coarse categories that any single helper inclusion implies (a tcp
    builtin sets ``threading=False, sockets`` -- though we currently
    fold sockets into helpers only).

    Today the bool flags duplicate information that ``helpers`` already
    encodes. We keep them explicit because:

    1. Some flags are set by code-walks, not by call-name lookup
       (``exceptions`` from try/catch nodes, ``inline_asm`` from
       A.InlineAsm) -- those will never be in ``helpers``.
    2. The emit consumers ask coarse questions (``if needs.threading``)
       far more often than fine ones (``if "thread_create" in helpers``).
